		<h5> SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS </h5>
		<p>
			The Proceedings of the conference will be published on <em>Collectio Ciphrarum - Proceedings of cryptographic conferences and workshops</em> (Aracne, Rome) in two different forms, according to the criteria specified below.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Authors who wish to give a talk should prepare an extended abstract of their work consisting of at least 5 pages and no more than 30 pages. Only previously unpublished contributions are considered.
		</p>
		<p> 
			After the review round, the accepted papers are divided in two categories:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> regular papers, </li>
			<li> selected papers. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> 
			Authors of regular papers are required to submit a revised version of their paper, meeting the style and page requirements that will be set by the Scientific Committee.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Authors whose paper has been accepted as "selected‚Äù can apply for inclusion in a special issue of <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/jmc/html"> <em> Journal of Mathematical Cryptology </em></a> (De Gruyter). The journal will further select which papers will be published (in revised form). These papers will be published in Open Access and will be free of any charge for the authors. Moreover, the authors of the journal papers will be required to provide a two-page abstract to appear in the Proceedings. Authors of selected papers that will not appear in the journal issue are required to submit a revised version of their paper, meeting the style and page requirements that will be set by the Scientific Committee, for inclusion in the Proceedings.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reviews of submissions are performed by the Programme Committee, under the guidance of the two Chairs.
		</p>

		<h5> INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS </h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Electronic submission of non-anonymous papers via EasyChair.</li>
			<li>Papers must be typeset using LaTeX in the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj">LNCS</a> style.</li>
			<li>We encourage authors to typeset the paper using Springer's LNCS LaTeX package with no changes to the style. Paper's length should range from 5 to 30 pages, excluding references and clearly marked appendices.
				Programme Committee members are not required to read appendices, so the paper should be intelligible without them.</li>
