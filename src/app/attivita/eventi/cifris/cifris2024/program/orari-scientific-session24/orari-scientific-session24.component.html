        The focus of this mini-session is the precise design of symmetric
        cryptosystems, in order to have them provably secure.
        Boolean functions represent a key ingredient in the cryptosystem design.
        This mini-session will start with a keynote by Prof.
        Emeritus Claude Carlet, considered by many the world expert on Boolean functions.

        Quadratic-like balanced functions and permutations
        <details>
            <summary>
                Abstract
            </summary>
            <i>
                The so-called (n,m)-functions have very nice properties when quadratic, which for instance ease the
                study of their
                almost perfect nonlinearity. But quadratic functions are weak against some other attacks. It is then
                important to study strict superclasses sharing some of these properties. In particular, when the
                block ciphers have a structure of substitution-permutation network (SPN), the substitution boxes must be
                permutations (m=n). <br>
                It is then essential to study superclasses of quadratic functions within the class of balanced
                functions. We shall introduce and study such a superclass, that of "quadratic-like balanced functions"
                ("permutations" when m=n).

        On second-order derivatives of Boolean functions and cubic APN permutations in even dimension
        <details>
            <summary>
                Abstract
            </summary>
            The big APN problem is one of the most important challenges in the theory of Boolean functions, i.e. finding
            a new APN permutation in even dimension. Among this class of functions, those with the lowest possible
            degree are cubic. Yet, none has been found so far. In this paper, we introduce new parameters for Boolean
            functions and for vectorial Boolean functions, mostly derived from the behavior of their second-order
            derivatives. These parameters are particularly relevant for small-degree functions. They allow studying
            bent, semi-bent and APN functions of degrees two and three. In particular, they allow tackling the big APN
            problem for cubic permutations.

        20 Years of Leakage-Resilient Cryptography
        <details>
            <summary>
                Abstract
            </summary>
            <i>
                Cryptographic schemes are usually analyzed under the assumption that the underlying secrets
                are
                fully hidden from the adversary. Unfortunately, history has taught us that many (otherwise provably
                secure)
                cryptosystems can be spectacularly broken by exploiting physical phenomena (the so-called side-channel
                attacks) resulting in partial information leakage about the underlying secret keys.
                <br>
                Leakage-resilient cryptography aims at closing the above gap by designing cryptosystems with provable
                guarantees even in the presence of attackers running different forms of side-channel attacks. This talk
                surveys the most important techniques behind leakage-resilient cryptography, since its introduction in
                the
                seminal works by Ishai, Sahai and Wagner (CRYPTO 2003) and Micali and Reyzin (TCC 2004).

        The focus of this mini-session are recent results on the design of ciphers
        that may resist attacks performed with quantum computers.
        Indeed, the quantum threat is the most feared in modern cryptography.
        This mini-session will start with a keynote by Prof. Simona Samardjiska, a
        young brilliant expert in this controversial field.

        Algorithms for solving the matrix code equivalence problem
        <br>
        <details>
            <summary>
                Abstract
            </summary>
            <i>
                In the past few years, there has been an increased interest in hard equivalence problems,
                especially with NIST's announcement of a fourth round for new designs of digital signatures.
                On a high level, such a problem can be defined as follows: Given two algebraic objects,
                find - if any - an equivalence that maps one object into the other.
                Several instantiations have been considered for cryptographic purposes, for example -
                Isomorphism of polynomials (Pattarin '96), Code equivalence (Biasse et al. '20),
                Matrix Code equivalence (Chou et al. '22), Alternating trilinear form equivalence
                (Tang et al.'22), Lattice isomorphism (Ducas & van Woerden '22). All of these problems
                are believed to be hard even for quantum adversaries. Conveniently, they can generically
                be used to build a Sigma protocol and further a post-quantum secure signature using the
                Fiat-Shamir transform.
                <br>
                In this talk I will make a broad overview of algorithms for solving the matrix code equivalence
                problem and how they can be applied to related problems. In particular, I will focus on
                algebraic and graph-based algorithms which are currently the state-of-the-art for solving the
                problem. I will further argue that clever combination of the two technics often leads to the best,
                and sometimes surprising results.

                Abstract
            </summary>
            This paper emphasizes the transition from classic SWHE schemes to modern approaches utilizing lattice-based
            problems, such as Learning With Errors (LWE). LWE, introduced by Regev, is central to both SWHE and FHE due
            to its security reductions to hard lattice problems, which are conjectured to be resistant to quantum
            attacks. This makes LWE-based schemes particularly attractive for constructing secure and efficient
            homomorphic encryption systems.
