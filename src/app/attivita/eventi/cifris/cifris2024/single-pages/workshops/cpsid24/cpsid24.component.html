<h1 style="text-align: center;">CPSID24 - Cryptography, Protocols and Security in Digital Identity 2024</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    The seminar dives into the two main current identity standards, EUDI-ARF and
    W3C-DID/W3C-VC and describe their cryptography, protocols, threat models and mitigations,
    highlighting pros and cons of each element. The seminar also offers a view about new and emerging
    cryptographic schemes in the identity space.

                In this talk we provide an overview of the ongoing digital identity efforts, focusing on the
                cryptography but including context about the political standpoints as well as the institutional and
                industry actors involved, int the EU and USA/Canada. We will provide a comparative analysis of the main
                cryptographic scheme used, along with communication protocols and the data formats for both digital
                identities and verifiable credentials. Some of the discussed subjects are:

                In our talks we will provide an in-depth analysis of the current status of the technical specification
                involved in the Wallet Architectures and Trust Infrastructure. The focus will then shift to the
                interoperability challenges at the European level, discussing the key requirements for a trust framework
                that ensures full interoperability. Finally, a concrete approach will be proposed to meet these
                requirements and guarantee seamless cross-border interactions between MS Wallet Solutions.

                Lattices play an important role in several branches of Mathematics, such as Algebra and Number Theory,
                becoming also very relevant in Cryptography in the last two decades. The aim of this talk is to explore
                how and why they acquired this importance, giving a concise but comprehensive overview. Starting from
                basic definitions and properties, we focus on some of the most important problems involving lattices. We
                consider these problems, their hardness and what algorithms we know to tackle them. Finally, we take a
                sharp look at the applications of lattices in Cryptography, especially in the Post Quantum scenario.
