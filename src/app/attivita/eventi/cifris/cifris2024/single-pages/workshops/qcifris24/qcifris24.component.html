<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Countering the growing level of cybercrime requires an ever-innovative approach. Quantum
    Technologies propose solutions for cryptographic key exchange and random number generation
    that are radically new compared to the algorithmic approach, with which they can be integrated to
    achieve the highest levels of security.
    The state of the art and perspectives in this area will be presented. The status of quantum
    computing in cryptanalysis will also be presented.

            Quantum communication protocols and quantum computing

                    Abstract
                </summary>
                Italy has been active in the development of quantum communications protocols for more than
                two decades, with groups of researchers perfecting different techniques and fields of application.
                Quantum communication protocols are also complemented by research and development at a
                very advanced level in the areas of quantum meteorology, experimental components
                development and the establishment of a nationwide infrastructure to enable communication on a
                large scale.
                In addition, our Country is also active in the research and development of quantum computing.
                This includes both a part of theoretical study of algorithms and is an experimental part for its
                implementation, in different platforms. Given the crucial significance of quantum computing in
                cyberattacks, this area is also of strategic importance in the field of cryptography.
