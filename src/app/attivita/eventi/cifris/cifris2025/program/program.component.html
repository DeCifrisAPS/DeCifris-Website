   <details>
     <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b></summary>
     Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic algorithms that  are, presumed, secure against quantum and classical computers.
A first set of PQC standards have been finalized by NIST in 2024-2025, marking the first step of a major upgrade of digital infrastructures to
these new standards.  It is, by far, the most important cryptographic transition ever performed, yet, and it needs to be completed as soon as 
possible due to steady  progress in quantum computing. For example, the EU commission recommends members states finalize the transition 
of critical infrastructures  by 2030-2035.
In this talk, we will provide an overview of PQC standards, as well as alternative approaches such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), to protect against the quantum threat. We will review the regulatory frameworks governing the quantum-safe transition and describe the main organizational and technical approaches 
developed so far to support this transition.

    <details>
<summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b></summary> 
The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. This method already proved effective in attacking the Trivium cipher. In this talk, we present a new implementation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We further introduce the notion of an "oracle function" as a general predictive tool for deciding whether the evaluation of a new variable is necessary to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we apply the multistep solving strategy to the cryptanalysis of the low-latency block cipher Aradi, recently introduced by the NSA. We present the first full-round algebraic attack, raising concerns about the cipher’s actual security with respect to its key length.

<details>
    <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
    Private information retrieval (PIR) addresses the question of how to retrieve data items from a database without disclosing information about the identity of the data items retrieved. The rate of a PIR scheme is measured as the ratio of the gained information over the downloaded information. Secure PIR complements this problem by further requiring the contents of the data to be kept secure. In particular, X-secure and T-private information retrieval (XST-PIR) is a form of PIR where data security is guaranteed against collusion among up to X servers and the user’s privacy is ensured against collusion among up to T servers. Cross-subspace alignment (CSA) Reed-Solomon codes have been recently proposed by Jia, Sun, and Jafar (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 65(9):5783–5798, 2019) as a means to construct XST-PIR schemes. Makkonen, Karpuk, and Hollanti reinterpret and generalize such CSA codes as algebraic geometric (AG) codes from curves of genus 0 and 1 (ISIT 2024, pp. 2874–2879), respectively, and from higher-genus hyperelliptic curves (arXiv:2408.00542, 2024). In this talk we show a XST-PIR scheme coming from Hermitian codes, i.e., AG codes over the Hermitian curve. Such a scheme offers interesting tradeoffs between the field size, file size, number of colluding servers, and the total number of servers. When the field size is fixed, this translates in some cases to higher retrieval rates than those of Makkonen et al. (2024). In addition, the new scheme exists also for some parameters where the original ones do not.

  <details>
<summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary> 
Multivariate cryptography is one of the main candidates for post-quantum cryptography. Traditional multivariate schemes are typically constructed by applying two secret affine invertible transformations to a set of secret multivariate polynomials, often quadratic. These secret polynomials contain a trapdoor that enables the legitimate user to solve the corresponding system efficiently, while the public polynomials appear indistinguishable from random ones. In this context, the secret and public key polynomials are said to be affine equivalent. In an effort to generalize this construction, we propose a new approach to construct a multivariate scheme by considering CCZ equivalence, a concept introduced and studied in the theory of vectorial Boolean functions. We explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of this construction. In particular, we present a cryptanalysis attempt aimed at assessing whether this approach indeed provides stronger or more general security guarantees compared to affine equivalence.
The talk is based on joint works with Marco Calderini, Elisa Gorla, Madison Mabe, Martina Vigorito, and Irene Villa.

Evolving secret sharing (Komargodski, Naor, and Yogev, TCC’16) generalizes the notion of secret sharing to the setting of evolving access structures, in which the shareholders are added to the system in an online manner, and where the dealer does not know neither the access structure nor the maximum number of parties in advance. Here, the main difficulty is to distribute shares to the new players without updating the shares of old players; moreover, one would like to minimize the share size as a function of the number of players. In this talk, I will review recent constructions of evolving secret sharing schemes for various access structures, with a particular focus on efficient and computationally secure schemes.

  <details>
<summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has attracted substantial attention from the international cryptographic community over the past decade, primarily due to its potential to safeguard data-in-use across a wide range of scenarios, with cloud computing being a leading example. However, the deployment of this technology in real-world applications remains limited by the considerable computational overhead inherent in current FHE schemes. One of the most promising approaches to reduce the computational cost of FHE and thereby broaden its applicability is the development of specialized accelerators for homomorphic encryption primitives. This talk will present the main techniques employed in this effort, with a particular focus on hardware acceleration, as well as some other key challenges that must be addressed to enable the widespread adoption of Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

We address the problem of anonymous access to restricted resources via distributed user registration, where multiple dealers collaboratively issue access tokens without compromising user anonymity towards a set of guards. Prior work proposed protocols with informal security arguments but lacked a formal model. We introduce an information-theoretic framework that rigorously defines correctness and security properties for such schemes, prove a lower bound on the private information each guard must hold, and present a simple, optimal construction leveraging secret sharing. Our results advance the design of unconditionally secure anonymous access protocols, relevant in the post-quantum era.

  <details>
<summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
Homomorphic encryption schemes enable computations on encrypted data, producing an encrypted result that can only be decrypted by the owner of the corresponding decryption key. A completely different approach is provided by functional encryption, which gives access to a function of some plaintexts working only on ciphertexts. Nevertheless, as shown in 2015 by Abdalla, Bourse, De Caro and Pointcheval, any (additive) homomorphic encryption scheme can be used to instantiate a functional encryption scheme for inner-product functionality. In this context, we will consider Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption to construct a functional encryption scheme supporting the inner product.

Subsequently, we will focus on the security proof of CROSS, in particular about how the fixed-weight parallel-repetition optimization employed in CROSS complicates its security analysis. We will present the first explicit proof of the EUF-CMA security of CROSS, demonstrating that the Fiat-Shamir transform of an HVZK and knowledge-sound multi-round interactive proof is EUF-CMA secure. Furthermore, we will present a novel forgery attack on signatures obtained from fixed-weight repetitions of 5-round interactive proofs, significantly improving upon previous results. As a consequence of this attack, CROSS parameters were modified between its first and second submissions.

  <details>
<summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
In various scenarios, it is necessary for a set of N users, each possessing a private/public key pair, to jointly sign a common message. Instead of sending N individual signatures, a multi-signature scheme enables a group of signers to produce a single, compact signature on the shared message, significantly reducing the communication overhead. Numerous practical multi-signature schemes have been developed under
pre-quantum assumptions. A notable example is MuSig2 (CRYPTO 2021), which builds upon Schnorr signatures based on the discrete logarithm problem. More recently, such efforts have been extended to the post-quantum setting, with lattice-based constructions like MuSig-L (CRYPTO 2022).
With the growing interest in group action-based signatures, a natural question arises: can we construct an efficient multi-signature scheme based on group action assumptions? In this talk, we present the first construction of such a scheme, relying on group action-based cryptographic assumptions. Our protocol is a 3-round scheme that
achieves concurrent security in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). We instantiate our construction using the three round-1 candidates from NIST’s additional call for post-quantum digital signatures: LESS, MEDS, and ALTEQ. Our implementation demonstrates favorable compression rates across various parameter sets.

  <details>
<summary>Abstract </summary>
Quantum computing poses a significant threat to modern classical cryptography.
To address this challenge, NIST has recently selected new standard protocols for post-quantum cryptography, specifically focusing on Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and post-quantum digital signatures.
Some products and networking protocols — such as TLS and SSH — have already begun integrating these standards, with many more following by offering them as selectable alternatives to classical cryptographic solutions.
However, there are contexts where even classical cryptography has faced persistent challenges due to constraints such as limited energy, real-time requirements, and low-latency demands. One such context is intra-vehicle communication, which involves the internal components of a vehicle (e.g., Electronic Control Units or ECUs).
In this talk, we explore how classical cryptography has been applied within intra-vehicle networks and discuss the potential for adopting post-quantum cryptography standards in this specialized domain.
Finally, we present a possible solution for implementing NIST's ML-KEM (Kyber) and Dilithium algorithms in CAN-based intra-vehicle communication systems.

    The adoption of e-voting in democratic elections has significantly increased in the recent years.
E-voting offers a convenient alternative to postal or in-person paper voting, while further providing cryptographic privacy of the votes and public verifiability of the whole process.
However, all currently deployed e-voting systems employ cryptographic protocols which will no longer be secure as soon as a powerful enough quantum computer becomes available.
Hence, in order to guarantee secure voting, it is important to design e-voting schemes from quantum-secure cryptographic primitives.
Due to the sensitivity of voting and the complexity of its infrastructures, this task poses a great challenge.
This talk will provide an overview of post-quantum e-voting, focusing on the different constructions and illustrating the state of the art quantum-safe e-voting protocols.

  <details>
    <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
    Blind signatures allow signing an encrypted message without being able to see the content of the message itself.
Many applications include signatures for encrypted votes or private transactions in a blockchain environment.
This technique, though, is still far from being practical for real-world scenarios.
In this proposal, we suggest an approach to perform blind signatures by combining three ingredients: a fully homomorphic encryption scheme, a hashing function, and a signature scheme.
We will consider the new GBFV (Geelen and Vercauteren, Eurocrypt '25) scheme, which natively supports the Goldilocks field as a plaintext modulus.
Moreover, the Poseidon2 hashing function performs computations in this field as well — this allows evaluating that circuit under GBFV naturally.
Lastly, we propose to sign the hashed message using a very simple, yet powerful, signature scheme based on the Lattice isomorphism problem, namely HAWK.

    The talk is devoted to generalization of the widely-used GLV decomposition for multi-scalar multiplication to a much broader range of elliptic curves with moderate CM discriminant D < 0. Previously, it was commonly believed that this technique can only be applied efficiently for small values of D, e.g., up to 100. In practice, curves with j-invariant 0 are most frequently employed, as they have the smallest possible D = -3. However, j = 0 curves are either too suspicious for conservative government regulators, e.g., for Russian ones, which prefer D = -619, or unavailable under imposed extra restrictions in a series of cryptographic settings. The new result thus contributes to the decade-long development of numerous curves with moderate D in the context of zk-SNARKs. Such curves are typically derived from others, which limits the ability to generate them while controlling the magnitude of D.

    Public-key cryptography relies on computational assumptions that guarantee the security of a scheme up to a certain bound, determined by the complexity of solving the underlying mathematical problem; such a resource-dependent definition is severely damaged by the awakening of quantum computers, on which new algorithms are available and old computational assumptions no longer hold. 
In this talk, we introduce the Hidden Subgroup Problem, which appears to be one of the minimal cryptographic assumptions, in the sense that most of the widely used assumptions can be efficiently recast as an instance thereof (e.g. discrete logarithm, integer factorization, but also shortest vector and others). 
The post-quantum relevance of this assumption is motivated by Kitaev algorithm, a quantum routine which generalizes Shor algorithm and efficiently solves the problem for abelian groups, delimiting the area of post-quantum only to those assumptions which reduce to non-abelian cases or do not reduce at all.

    In 1999, Kocher et al. introduced Differential Power Analysis (DPA), an attack that uses the power consumption of a device to retrieve the secret key. As a result, side-channel countermeasures were developed, aiming for the secure implementation of symmetric primitives. In the same year, the masking technique was developed as a countermeasure, but the technique alone does not account for physical behaviours such as glitches. In 2006, Nikova et al. proposed a masking-based technique called Threshold Implementation (TI) to solve this issue. A common use of this technique is to decompose an encryption algorithm into components separated by registers, with the condition that each component satisfies the properties required by the TI technique. However, a naive application of this technique may result in implementations that are either too large to fit in the target device, are too slow to meet the required performance or do not meet the security requirements. So many designs use on-line randomness to meet those requirements. However, in practice, this procedure can be resource-demanding and introduce weaknesses if not done properly. In this talk, we present recent advancements on TI without on-line randomness and discuss future challenges.

  <details>
    <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
    Modern symmetric ciphers commonly employ permutation polynomials as core components, AES being a prime example. The implementations of these ciphers in hardware need to provide resistance to side-channel analysis and physical tampering. In some of the techniques used for achieving this, such as masking, the algebraic degree of the permutation polynomial used in the cipher affects the hardware area of the implementation proportionally. At the same time, permutation polynomials suitable for cryptographic use are most often of high algebraic degree. To address this issue and reduce the hardware area while maintaining the security of the cipher, one can decompose high algebraic degree polynomials into polynomials of small algebraic degrees which can be implemented more efficiently. In this talk we will discuss the state of the art in this respect and provide directions for future research.

  <details>
    <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
    In Neural Cryptanalysis, a deep neural network is trained as a cryptographic distinguisher between pairs of ciphertexts (F(X), F(X + &delta; )), where F is either a random permutation or a block cipher, &delta; is a fixed difference. The AutoND framework aims to use neural distinguishers that are treated as a generic tool and discourages cipher-specific optimizations. On the other hand, other works obtain superior distinguishers by adding dedicated features, such as selected parts of the difference in the previous rounds, to the input of the neural distinguishers. In this paper, we study <b>Generic Partial Decryption</b> as a feature engineering technique and integrate it within a fully automated pipeline, where we evaluate its effect independently of the number of pairs per sample, with which feature engineering is often combined. We show that this technique matches state-of-the-art dedicated approaches on Simon and Simeck. Additionally, we apply it to Aradi and present a practical neural-assisted key recovery for 5 rounds, as well as a 7-rounds key recovery with 2^70 time complexity. Additionally, we derive useful information from the neural distinguishers and propose a non-neural version of our 5-round key recovery.

  <details>
    <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
In 2009 Etzion and Silberstein proved a combinatorial upper bound on the largest dimension of a rank-metric code over a finite field whose nonzero matrices are supported on a given Ferrers diagram and all have rank lower bounded by a fixed positive integer r. In the same paper, they also conjectured that such an upper bound is always tight: that is, for every r and Ferrers diagram D there exists an optimal rank-metric code supported on D. Since then, their conjecture has been verified in a number of cases, but as of today it still remains widely open. In this talk, we investigate the notion of reducibility of Ferrers diagrams: a diagram D reduces to D′ if an optimal code supported on D can be obtained by shortening or inclusion of an optimal code supported on D′.
This induces a natural notion of irreducibility of Ferrers diagrams, and the validity of the conjecture for irreducible diagrams implies the validity of the full conjecture for all diagrams. Moreover, following the notion of irreducibility, we can provide the Hasse diagram of Young &#39; s lattice with an orientation. This produces a directed graph in which sources correspond to irreducible diagrams. As our main result, we give a combinatorial characterization of irreducible diagrams, as the integer points of aspecial polytope of dimension 2r-3. This talk is based on a joint work with Hugo Sauerbier Couvée.

  <details>
    <summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
    In recent years, rank-metric codes have attracted growing attention due to their numerous applications in practical scenarios and their deep connections with various algebraic and combinatorial structures. A particularly relevant class is that of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes, which attain the largest possible size for a given minimum distance.
In this talk, we introduce a new family of MRD codes, obtained from suitable subsets of quotient spaces of skew polynomial rings. This framework unifies several previously known constructions. We compute invariants for these codes and show that this family provides infinitely many new examples of MRD codes.
Finally, we present a Welch–Berlekamp like algorithm for decoding MRD codes within these new families.
This is joint work with Eimear Byrne, F. J. Lobillo, Arani Paul, and John Sheekey.

<p class="speaker-title" style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">  <b>Invited talk: </b><i>Paolo Santini</i> (Università Politecnica delle Marche)</p><p class="talk-title">Riding a BIKE with failures (without falling down too many times)</p>   <details>
<summary><b><i>Abstract</i></b> </summary>
Quasi-Cyclic Moderate-Density Parity-Check (QC-MDPC) codes offer a very simple and competitive way to build post-quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). Examples of cryptosystems based on such codes are LEDAcrypt and BIKE, with the latter having been one of the finalists in the NIST competition, together with HQC and ClassicMcEliece. The fundamental issue with BIKE is in the difficulty of assessing the Decryption Failure Rate (DFR) and, in particular, in proving that the DFR can be negligible in the security parameter (say, less than 2^(-128) for NIST category 1). This comes from the difficulty of modeling the behaviour of the employed decoder, called Bit Flipping (BF). This may seem paradoxical since the BF is a very basic and simple decoder, still, despite many years of research, no appealing solution has been found. Solving the DFR issue, i.e., finding a good and reliable theoretical model for a competitive BF decoder would finalize the construction of a KEM based on QC-MDPC codes and, arguably, would represent a breakthrough in post-quantum cryptography.

In this talk we recall how BIKE works and then focus on BF decoding, aiming to explain why estimating the DFR is so complicated. We will also briefly recall the most relevant approaches to model the DFR. The talk shall be intended as a high level discussion about the DFR issue, with the aim of raising interest and stimulating new and fresh ideas for this simple to describe, yet intrinsically difficult, open problem.
