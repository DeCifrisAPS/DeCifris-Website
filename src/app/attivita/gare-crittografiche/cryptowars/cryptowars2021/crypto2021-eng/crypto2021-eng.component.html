		<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Do I have to personally implement some code to solve the questions? </i><br>
					It is not required to send the used code, so an easy way is to
					look for some code already implemented. The fact remains that, as the race has above all
					meant to lead to deep understanding of cryptographic problems, it is advised
					to work independently on their own code and its optimization. <br>
				</li>
				<li><i>Do I need to think about and implement new attacks?</i><br>
					Not necessarily. There are many known attacks in the literature, so look for one that
					it seems easy to understand, implement it and get it running!
