		<h3 align="center">DE CIFRIS TRENDS IN CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS</h3>
		<p>
			The research activity carried out within the Italian cryptographic community, both in the
			academic field and in the world of work and business, has recently given rise to the
			association of social promotion De Componendis Cifris.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among the many purposes of the association, there is support for the study and research in 
			cryptography; therefore, it also promotes and coordinates educational and dissemination
			activities at a national level.
			With this in mind, the association promotes the course Trends in
			Cryptographic Protocols, which involves ten lecturers from Italian and foreign universities
			and research centers (a <a [routerLink]="['/trends22']">similar course</a> was held last year).
		</p>
		<p>
			This course will disclose methods and techniques used in creating modern cryptographic
			protocols. Based on these protocols, telecommunications and information systems can
			nowadays enjoy the peak of cryptography developments.
		</p>
		<p>
			The course is particularly well suited for MSC students interested in cryptography. However,
			anyone familiar with standard cryptography and its mathematical background can attend this
			course, including Ph.D. students, MSC graduates, and professionals working for companies
			or for the public sector.
